# Setup

Must have a Spotify account and set your own environment values for client ID, client secret, and secret key as well as specify a callback URI which can be found on Spotify's developer website when creating an account. Install the necessary dependencies (flask, dotenv, requests) then you should be all setup

# Takeaways

This project was really fun for me as I was able about publicly accessible API endpoints and got to experiment with endpoints, and authorization tokens, and see my own music data on my application. I was able to practice my web skills with a small flask app using python and html templating. Hopefully in the future I can expand upon this to allow for creation of playlists, listening to demos of songs on the app, and adding songs to playlists on the app.
